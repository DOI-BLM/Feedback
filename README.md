Repo soliciting feedback from BLM developers
My name is Doug finnefrock - my Boss, Chris Youll has asked that I set up a BLM-wide Github presence along with foundational guidance for its use.   We encourage you to please provide feedback to this repo in the form of "issues" so we can make it better for the entire BLM development community.
